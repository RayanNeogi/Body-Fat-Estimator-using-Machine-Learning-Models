# Body-Fat-Estimator-using-Machine-Learning-Models
A machine learning-based body fat estimator that predicts body fat percentage using anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist, hip, and other relevant metrics. This project includes:

Data preprocessing: Cleans and prepares datasets for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes relationships between physical measurements and body fat percentage.

Model development: Employs algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) to estimate body fat based on user input features.

Performance evaluation: Assesses and visualizes model accuracy using metrics such as RÂ² and MSE.
